nifty
=====

J implementation of NIF file support. See also: http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/About_NifTools

---------------------------------------------------------

Currently early draft

Version hardcoded to Morrowind

Files should go in obvious locations in J user directory

(Polish must wait until after functionality.)

---------------------------------------------------------

parsed nif file currently appears as DATANIF_readnif_ and the orcish table example is automatically parsed when readnif.ijs is loaded.
